Without braces, indentation becomes matter.
1 indentation level will take the role of braces.
For instance:
a
if (b) {
    c;
}
d
Is the same as:
a
if (b)
    c
d
By default, x indentation levels are just 4x spaces. This is configurable.
The same applies to semicolons.
2 lines will be regarded as 1 line if and only if the 1st one doesn't end with a semicolon and the 2nd one has 2 indentation levels relative to the 1st one.
