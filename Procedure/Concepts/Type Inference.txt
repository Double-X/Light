By default, types should be explicitly declared in Light Procedure.
If they are not so, the compiler will try to infer the type.
For value types, the type will be inferred from that of the assigned values.
For structs, the type will be inferred from its contained field being used.
For function pointers, type inference is the same as signature checking.
