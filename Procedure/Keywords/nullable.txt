nullable is a keyword for pointers in Light Procedure.
By default, pointers can't point to null without this keyword. Violating this is a compilation error.
With this keyword, programmers only have to check against pointers explicitly marked as nullable.
Checking whether a pointer's null for non nullable ones will receive a warning.
Applying this to function arguments means less argument cleansing.
Applying this to function return values means making that function much more user-friendly.
