subtype is a keyword to declare subtypes in Light Procedure.
A subtype is a type with additional bounds.
Its syntax is as follows:
subtype newType bound ftpr oldType
ftpr must be a function pointer pointing to a pure function accepting exactly 1 argument, which is the value of newType.
Also, newType is oldType but oldType is not newType.
