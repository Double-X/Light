idempotent is a keyword for functions in Light Procedure.
This keyword can't be used with nullipotent nor pure for the same function.
A function is said to be idempotent if calling it once is exactly the same as calling it more than once consecutively.
There are built-in idempotent functions and operators.
A function can only be marked as idempotent if and only if all its statements are idempotent and all idempotent but not nullipotent ones are orthagonal to each other.
If the compiler can't be sure that 2 idempotent statements are orthagonal to each other, then they'll be regarded as not orthagonal to each other.
Violating this is a compilation error.
The compiler can be set to issue warnings rather than errors for idempotent functions violating this rule.
Note that a nullipotent function is always idempotent, while the converse isn't necessarily true.
