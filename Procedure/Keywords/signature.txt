signature is a keyword for function pointers in Light Procedure.
signature is a special type of struct specifying a function's precondition, return type, argument list and postconditions.
Its syntax is as follows:
signature sign1 = {
    precond: ftpr1,
    return: int bound ftpr2,
    args: [float bound ftpr3, double],
    postcond: null // No postcondition
};
A function matches a signature if and only if:
1. Its precondition is not stricter than that of the signature
2. Its return type is not looser than that of the signature
3. It has the same number of arguments as those of the signature and all of the former are not stricter than their counterparts in the latter
4. Its postcondition is not looser than that of the signature
