nullipotent is a keyword for functions in Light Procedure.
A function is said to be nullipotent if and only if it causes no side effects.
There are built-in nullipotent functions and operators.
A function can only be marked as nullipotent if and only if all its statements are nullipotent.
Note that a pure function is always nullipotent while the converse isn't necessarily true.
