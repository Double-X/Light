nullipotent is a keyword for functions in Light Procedure.
This keyword can't be used with idempotent nor pure for the same function. Violating this is a compilation error.
A function is said to be nullipotent if and only if it causes no side effects.
There are built-in nullipotent functions and operators.
A function can only be marked as nullipotent if and only if all its statements are nullipotent or pure. Violating this is a compilation error.
The compiler can be set to issue warnings rather than errors for nullipotent functions violating this rule.
Note that a pure function is always nullipotent which is always idempotent while the converse isn't necessarily true.
Non void functions not marked with nullipotent or pure will receive warnings.
