var is a keyword for variables and arguments in Light Procedure.
By default, variables/arguments without the var keyword are constants.
For pointers, having no var keywords also means they're pointers to constants.
For instance, this is a constant pointer to a constant:
int* ptr1;
This is a pointer to a constant:
var int* ptr1;
This is a constant pointer:
int* var ptr1;
This is a pointer:
var int* var ptr1;
Using the var keyword for arguments will receive a warning.
