throws is a keyword for functions in Light Procedure.
If a function can throw an exception, it must be declared this way:
void function() throws exception;
The functions calling those throwing exceptions must either catch them or throw those exceptions themselves as well.
Violating this is a compilation error. It implies that all declared exceptions are checked.
On the other hand, a function throwing no exceptions doesn't mean it's safe. Truly safe ones are marked with the safe keyword.
