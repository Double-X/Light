safe is a keyword for functions in Light Procedure.
A function is said to be safe if and only if calling it can never crash the program.
There are built-in safe functions and operators.
A function can only be marked as safe if and only if all its statements are safe or it has a try-catch-finally block.
The syntax of the safe keyword is as follows:
safe void test();
